CARB is a part of the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) and exists to promote and protect public health, welfare and ecological resources through the effective and efficient reduction of air pollutants while recognizing and considering the effects on the economy of the state. CVRP funding is determined by an annual funding plan that is developed with public input and approved by CARB.</blockquote>
